# MNIST-Digit-Classification

<br/>This is a ipynb notebook on digit classification using Tensorflow framework and keras library <br/>
Training is done on dataset provided by keras<br/>
4 layer architecture is used<br/>
Layer 1 contains 784 number of neurons<br/>
Layer 2 and 3 contains 256 neurons each <br/>
Layer 4 contains contains 10 number of neurons representing the output from 0 to 9.<br/>
SGD with ADAM optimizer and cross entropy as loss function is used.
